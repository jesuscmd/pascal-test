# Pascal Triangle Inverted - Technical Test

This project is a technical test for [Company Name], built with Svelte, demonstrating an inverted Pascal Triangle. The triangle visualization allows users to dynamically adjust the number of rows and interact with the interface through a sidebar, offering controls for resizing the triangle. The goal of this project is to showcase the ability to use Svelte and modern front-end technologies to create interactive and responsive visual components.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of this project at the following URL:

[https://pascal-triangle-test.netlify.app](https://pascal-triangle-test.netlify.app)

## Project Overview

The core feature of this test is the inverted Pascal Triangle, which is a mathematical structure where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The twist here is that the triangle is visualized in an inverted manner, and users can interact with the interface to dynamically change the number of rows displayed.

### Key Features

- **Inverted Pascal Triangle**: A visual representation of the Pascal Triangle, inverted for this specific test.
- **Dynamic Controls**: The triangle can be resized dynamically through the sidebar controls, where users can increase or decrease the number of rows, or input a value manually.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is built with Svelte and is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
